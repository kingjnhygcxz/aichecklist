🚀 CPANEL NODE.JS APPLICATION REGISTRATION
==========================================

STEP 1: FIND NODE.JS SECTION
============================
In cPanel, look for:
- "Node.js Apps" or
- "Node.js Selector" or  
- "Application Manager"

Click "Register New Application" or "Create Application"

STEP 2: FILL IN APPLICATION DETAILS
===================================
Application Name: AIChecklist-IO
Application Root: public_html (or your current folder)
Application URL: http://your-domain.com
Application Startup File: dist/index.js (CRITICAL - NOT server/index.ts!)
Node.js Version: 18.x or higher
Application Mode: production (CRITICAL - NOT development!)

STEP 3: ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=================================
In the environment variables section, add:

NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key  
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
FROM_EMAIL=your_email_address
PORT=5000

STEP 4: CLICK CREATE/REGISTER
=============================
Save the application configuration.

STEP 5: START THE APPLICATION
============================
In cPanel, click "Start" or "Run" on your registered application.

VERIFICATION:
============
- Visit: http://your-domain.com/api/health
- Should return JSON status (no Vite errors!)
- Visit: http://your-domain.com/
- Should load your AIChecklist.io app

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
If still getting Vite errors:
1. Double-check Startup File is "dist/index.js" (not server/index.ts)
2. Make sure Mode is "production" (not development)  
3. Verify dist/index.js file exists in your folder
4. Restart the application in cPanel

WHY THIS WORKS:
==============
- dist/index.js = production build (no Vite)
- server/index.ts = development code (causes Vite errors)
- production mode = uses built files
- development mode = uses Vite dev server
