🚨 URGENT - VITE DEPLOYMENT ERROR FIX
=====================================

YOUR ISSUE: You're running DEVELOPMENT mode on PRODUCTION server!
The Vite error means you're using "npm run dev" instead of "npm start"

IMMEDIATE FIX - RUN THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER:
===========================================

1. STOP the current server process (Ctrl+C)

2. DELETE development files:
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf dist

3. REINSTALL everything:
   npm install

4. BUILD for production:
   npm run build
   
   ⚠️  This step is CRITICAL - it creates dist/index.js

5. START production server:
   npm start
   
   ⚠️  NOT "npm run dev" - that's development only!

VERIFY IT WORKS:
===============
- Server should start without Vite errors
- Visit: http://your-domain.com/api/health
- Should return JSON with status: "healthy"

WHAT WAS WRONG:
==============
❌ You were running: npm run dev (development)
✅ You should run: npm start (production)

The error "Cannot find module vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-UEPspf5j.js" 
happens because Vite development files don't exist in production!

ENVIRONMENT CHECK:
=================
Make sure these environment variables are set:
- NODE_ENV=production
- DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
- OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
- RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
- FROM_EMAIL=your_email

If you're STILL getting errors after this:
==========================================
1. Check your process manager (PM2, systemd, etc.)
2. Make sure it's running "npm start" NOT "npm run dev"
3. Check that dist/index.js exists after "npm run build"
4. Restart your web server (nginx/apache) if needed

CONTACT US if this doesn't work - but follow these steps EXACTLY first!
